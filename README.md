The Github repository contains the dataset (as a csv file) collected from a shrimp farm in andhra pradesh, india. The dataset contains the following features:
1) time of observation,
2) air temperature ,
3) water temperature ,
4) dissolved oxygen(DO) ,
5) Barometric Pressure,
6) humidity and
7) light dependent resistor(ldr).

The dataset can be used to train a ML model to predict Dissolved oxygen using the other features.
