The Github repository contains the dataset (as a csv file) collected from a shrimp farm in Andhra Pradesh, India. The dataset contains the following features:
1) Time of observation,
2) Air temperature ,
3) Water temperature ,
4) Dissolved oxygen(DO) ,
5) Barometric Pressure,
6) Humidity and
7) Light dependent resistor (LDR).

The dataset can be used to train a ML model to predict Dissolved oxygen using the other features.
